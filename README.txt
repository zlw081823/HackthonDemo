Introduction to the DEMO

The idea is simple:

Kitty is the cat who rescues those that are injured.
Cathy is the girl who hurts herself in the wild.

Game rule:

* Kitty is the rescue cat who runs around and help those who are injured. To control the cat, use up & down & left & right arrow on your keyboard
* Condition for Cathy being helped: Kitty the rescuer needs to approach/touch Cathy
* Rule for winning the game: if Cathy’s health stays above 0 for more than 60 seconds
* Rule for losing the game: if Cathy’s health reaches 0 within 60 seconds
